    <p>The four-star AniMix Hotel is a jewel of the 20th century architecture, located in Hyederabad. Because of our prestigious location, we have already for 150 years been a perfect haven both for people travelling for tourist, as well as business purposes.

        We have 72 comfortably equipped rooms, including two suites: The President Suite and the Ambassador Suite, with over one hundred metres of surface area, which are sure to awe even the most demanding Guests. We offer 7 rooms, where we have been preparing family and business meetings.
        
        The AniMix Hotel is not merely the building but, above all, its people. We are a team of professionals, who can organise every event end-to-end.
        
        We have many years of experience, extensive conference facilities, as well as technical and catering equipment, and we will be more than happy to organise your meeting â€“ both in our building, in a tent at the hotel's patio, as well as in any other place of your choosing.</p>
