        <h3>About Bootstrap</h3>    
        <p>
           <h1> Bootstrap, originally named Twitter 
            Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and 
            Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to
             encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used
              for interface development, which led t
              o inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
               According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:</h1>

<h1>A super small group of developers and I got 
together to design and build a new internal
 tool and saw an opportunity to do something more.
  Through that process, we saw ourselves build something
   much more substantial than another internal tool.
    Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way
     to document and share common design patterns and 
     assets within the company.</h1>

<h1>After a few months of development by a small group,
 many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the
  project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week
   for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from
    Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an
     open source project on August 19, 2011. It has
      continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob
       Thornton, and a 
small group of core developers, as well as a 
large community of contributors.</h1>
